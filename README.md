# 🐦 Twitter Analytics Dashboard – Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my internship with **Nullclass**, where I developed a **Real-Time Twitter Analytics Dashboard** using Power BI.  
The dashboard provides deep insights into tweet performance, user engagement, impressions, and interaction types with advanced conditional filters.

## ⚡ Features
- **Scatter Chart** → Media Engagements vs Media Views (Replies > 10, Engagement Rate > 5%, Odd dates, Word count > 50).  
- **Clustered Bar Chart** → URL Clicks, Profile Clicks, Hashtag Clicks by Tweet Category (Even dates, Word count > 40).  
- **Top 10 Tweets** → Highest Retweets + Likes (Excluding weekends, Word count < 30).  
- **Line Chart** → Monthly Engagement Rate trend (Media vs Non-Media tweets, Character count > 20, excluding words with "C").  
- **Replies/Retweets/Likes Comparison** → Only tweets with Media Engagements above median (Character count > 20, excluding words with "S").  
- **Engagement Rate Comparison** → Tweets with vs without App Opens (Character count > 30, excluding words with "D").  

Each visualization is displayed **only during specific IST time windows** as per assignment requirements.
